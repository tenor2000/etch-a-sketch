HTML Structure: I learned how to structure the HTML elements for my etch-a-sketch program, including the container, controls, sketchbox, and color palette.

CSS Styling: I applied CSS styles to create the visual layout and appearance of my etch-a-sketch program, including the grid layout, colors, buttons, and background image.

JavaScript Interactivity: I implemented JavaScript functions to handle user interactions, such as drawing on the sketchbox, changing grid size, clearing the grid, and selecting colors from the palette.

Event Handling: I used event listeners to detect mouse actions like mousedown, mouseup, and mouseenter to enable drawing functionality.

Dynamic Grid Creation: I created a dynamic grid based on the selected grid size, allowing me to customize the drawing area.


Color Palette: I implemented a color palette with various color options for drawing, including black, red, purple, blue, green, yellow, and an eraser option.
Background Image: I added a background image to the container, enhancing the visual appeal of my etch-a-sketch program.

Responsive Design: I ensured that my etch-a-sketch program is responsive by allowing the background image to scale with the page and remain centered.

Overall, I've gained hands-on experience in building an interactive web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a fun and engaging addition to my portfolio website.
